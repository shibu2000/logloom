## 🧠 About LogLoom

**LogLoom** is a calm, offline-first mobile application designed to help you capture moments, decisions, and reflections — and weave them into connected thinking over time.

Unlike traditional note-taking apps, LogLoom focuses on **context**:
not just _what_ happened, but _why_, _what you did_, and _what you learned_.

It’s a thinking companion — not a task manager, not a noisy notes app.

---

## ✨ Why LogLoom?

Most tools store information.  
LogLoom preserves **reasoning**.

Built for:

- Reflecting on decisions
- Tracking recurring problems
- Revisiting past context
- Learning from outcomes over time

Designed to stay calm, focused, and distraction-free.

---

## 🧵 Core Concept

Each entry in LogLoom is called a **Context**, structured as:

- **Situation** — What triggered this moment?
- **Problem** — What was the core issue?
- **Action** — What did you do or plan to do?
- **Outcome** — What happened or is expected?
- **Reflection** — What did you learn?

Over time, these contexts form a **connected timeline** you can revisit anytime.
